This is a task that you are to do in its entirety. Before starting, plan a step-by-step plan how to complete the entire instruction.
1. Check if there are unreviewed articles (in the _post/ folder). Any article in _posts folder which isn't listed in the edited-articles.md is unreviewed.
2. Follow the editing instructions beneath these steps for each article.
3. Once complete, add the name of the article to the edited-articles.md file.

Editing Instructions:
Edit the provided posts to improve writing quality while preserving content and structure.

Scope of fixes:

- Spelling, grammar, punctuation, and hyphenation (e.g., “follow-up”, “okay”).
- Language and naming consistency (e.g., “GOG”, “SnowRunner”, “Pillars of Eternity”, “Steam”).
- Heading syntax (e.g., “## A …”, not “##A …”).
- Number formatting and symbols:
    - Use space as thousands separators: 10 000 instead of 10,000.
    - Currency without commas: $1000 not $1,000.
    - Use en dashes for numeric ranges (2019–2022, 10–20).
    - Format dates as year-month-day or dayth Month
    - Percent as “%” with no preceding space (e.g., 70%).
- Capitalization rules:
    - Front matter:
        - title: Title Case (keep deliberate stylization if present)
        - categories: Capitalized (e.g., “Game Industry”, “Indie”)
        - tags: Title Case (e.g., “Doing Things”, “Game Design”)
    - Proper nouns correctly capitalized (product and game names).
    - Headers should be in Pascal case, but lower case filler words. Examples: "This is a Header" "Best Game I've Ever Seen" 
- List and table consistency (commas, periods, spacing) without reordering.
- YAML front matter validity and indentation preserved.

Do NOT:

- Add or remove content, reorder sections, or change meaning.
- Restructure sentences beyond minimal edits to reduce awkwardness.
- Change voice/tone beyond consistency and clarity.

Style grounding:

1. Before editing, read writing-style-guide.md to learn the style of my writing.
2. Apply that style consistently to all edits. If it does not make sense to apply, ask follow up questions. Do not presume.

Tags:
Standard tags I use: Doing Things, Game Industry, Indie Games, LLM, My Product, Nonsenes, My Project, Product Management, Using AI
1. Tags should be capitalized at the start of each word.
2. If I use a tag which I have never used before, that is likely an error. Ask a follow up question if I'd like to add a new tag. If I say yes, add it to the list above.

Categories:
All articles should have two categories. The first category should always be "Game Industry", "Product Management", "AI", and "Whatever". The second category can be whatever, as long as each word is categorized.

Uncertainty handling:

- If any fix is ambiguous or would require larger rewrites, pause and ask follow-up questions.
- If a recurring pattern requires a preference (e.g., tag capitalization, number formatting), ask once, then apply consistently.
- If you ask follow up questions, add my response to the writing-style-guide.md file.

Output:

- Edit files in place, preserving existing indentation and file format structure.
- Keep all headings, blocks, images, and links unchanged except for necessary corrections.
