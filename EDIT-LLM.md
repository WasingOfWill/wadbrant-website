This is a task that you are to do in its entirety. Before starting, plan a step-by-step plan how to complete the entire instruction.
1. Check if there are unreviewed articles (in the _post/ folder). Any article in _posts folder which isn't listed in the edited-articles.md is unreviewed.
2. Follow the editing instructions beneath these steps for each article.
3. Once complete, add the name of the article to the edited-articles.md file.

Editing Instructions:
Edit the provided posts to improve writing quality while preserving content and structure.

Scope of fixes:

- Spelling, grammar, punctuation, and hyphenation (e.g., “follow-up”, “okay”).
- Language and naming consistency (e.g., “GOG”, “SnowRunner”, “Pillars of Eternity”, “Steam”).
- Heading syntax (e.g., “## A …”, not “##A …”).
- Number formatting and symbols:
    - Use thousands separators: 10,000 not 10 000.
    - Currency with commas: $1,000 not $1000.
    - Use en dashes for numeric ranges (2019–2022, 10–20).
    - Percent as “%” with no preceding space (e.g., 70%).
- Capitalization rules:
    - Front matter:
        - title: Title Case (keep deliberate stylization if present)
        - categories: Capitalized (e.g., “Game Industry”, “Indie”)
        - tags: Title Case (e.g., “Doing Things”, “Game Design”)
    - In text: “markdown” lowercase.
    - Proper nouns correctly capitalized (product and game names).
- List and table consistency (commas, periods, spacing) without reordering.
- YAML front matter validity and indentation preserved.

Do NOT:

- Add or remove content, reorder sections, or change meaning.
- Restructure sentences beyond minimal edits to reduce awkwardness.
- Change voice/tone beyond consistency and clarity.

Style grounding:

1. Before editing, read at least three other posts in `_posts` to learn tone, capitalization, and symbol usage.
2. Apply that style consistently to all edits.

Uncertainty handling:

- If any fix is ambiguous or would require larger rewrites, pause and ask follow-up questions.
- If a recurring pattern requires a preference (e.g., tag capitalization, number formatting), ask once, then apply consistently.

Output:

- Edit files in place, preserving existing indentation and file format structure.
- Keep all headings, blocks, images, and links unchanged except for necessary corrections.

Checklist (apply to every post):

- [ ]  Front matter capitalization (title/categories/tags) and validity.
- [ ]  Spelling/grammar/punctuation/hyphenation.
- [ ]  Number formatting (commas, currency, ranges, %).
- [ ]  Proper nouns and product names.

- [ ]  “markdown” lowercase in text.
- [ ]  No content additions or restructuring.
