*Return of the Obra Dinn - One of the most successful Fill-it-Out Mystery games*

## How Does a "Fill-it-Out" Mystery Game Work?

When people talk about mystery games, they often jump straight to the vibe: dusty libraries, foggy streets, cozy parlors with tea, or shadowy crime scenes. But if you look past the atmosphere, you’ll notice that most detective-style games on PC share a core set of mechanics.

I like to call this type of game a Fill-it-Out Mystery. You start with a little skeleton of knowledge, and then slowly fill in the blanks until the bigger picture emerges. Whether you’re solving murders on a doomed ship (Return of the Obra Dinn), piecing together a cursed golden idol, or identifying flowers in a cozy plant shop, the bones of the gameplay are surprisingly similar.

## The Core Ingredients of a Fill-it-Out Mystery

Here are the mechanics that almost every game in this genre leans on:

### Base Knowledge
The "anchor" that gets you started. Maybe it's a family tree, a set of character portraits, or even just one artifact that sets the scene. Without this, players feel lost right from the beginning.

### Artifacts
Your information bank. These could be 3D scenes to wander through, documents, letters, or even plants. You can check and re-check them forever, and they're where most clues live.

### Discovery
How you grow your bank of artifacts. Some games gate progress behind solving puzzles (*Obra Dinn*, *Golden Idol*), while others give you locations to visit or keywords to chase (*Roottrees*, *Sherlock*).

### Truths
The actual facts you're trying to nail down. Who died where? Which plant is which? How are these people related? These are the "answers" you'll eventually plug into the framework.

### Soft Progress
A way to keep moving forward even when the hard puzzles stump you. Notes, labels, or partial guesses help avoid dead-ends.

### Hard Progress
The game's way of confirming you're right. *Obra Dinn* locks in every three correct identifications. *Golden Idol* confirms a whole chapter at once. Without this, mysteries feel endless and exhausting.

### Meta Indicators
Little nudges that stop you from flailing around. Difficulty ratings, hints, or blurred-out options remind you what's currently solvable and what isn't.

### Atmosphere
The glue that holds it all together. The mechanics might be similar, but the feel is what sets games apart: *Obra Dinn's* bleak tragedy vs. *Strange Horticulture's* cozy tea-time puzzle-solving.

## Where Games Trip Up

If a game misses one of these pillars, players notice:

- No base knowledge? You're lost before you begin.
- No discovery? Everything is dumped on you at once, which kills pacing.
- No soft progress? You're stuck staring at the same riddle forever.
- No meta indicators? You waste time trying to solve things that aren't solvable yet.
- No atmosphere? Even if the mechanics are solid, the game just feels bland.

It's a delicate balance: a little too loose and players feel adrift, a little too rigid and they feel railroaded.

## Why This Matters

Once you learn to spot these mechanics, you can evaluate mystery games without even touching the theme. Whether it's Victorian detectives, cursed idols, or cozy plant shops, the Fill-it-Out Mystery genre is really about how games structure knowledge, discovery, and confirmation.

So next time you're browsing Steam and see a "detective" or "investigation" tag, ask yourself:

- What's the base knowledge?
- How do I discover new clues?
- How does the game confirm I'm right?
- And does the atmosphere match the detective fantasy it's selling?

Answer those, and you'll know exactly what kind of mystery experience you're in for.
