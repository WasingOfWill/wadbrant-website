Steam is the #1 platform for PC gaming. Many game developers see it as the only target to release on (even if both Epic and GoG is slowly growing). But Steam is brutal to those who go in with nothing but a dream to make a game. My indie game ([Yaengard, the Personality Trait RPG](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1545830/Yaengard/)) sold about 6000 copies. It was around our expectations. We decided early that Yaengard was a passion-first project. "Business is secondary" was said multiple times. We needed about double to justify building game #2, which would have been exciting. But life happens, and whop-bam I go into commercial cross-platform gaming instead. 

I felt like Yaengard was a failure on the business side (even if that was the intention!). Yet, Yaengard was in the top 4% of games released on Steam during 2022. That makes me think: "If I think Yaengard was a failure, what happened to the 96% of games that had worse releases?".

Ouch.

Let's break down what happens to most games on Steam. 

## Some truths about Steam

**Releases & Sales**
- In the span of 2023 and September 2025 (now), 42 126 games were released on Steam.
- 42% (~18 000 games) never sold 100 copies.
- 66% (~28K games) never made $1000.
- 83% of games in this span makes less than $10 000. This becomes $5600 after sales tax, local pricing, and Steams 30% cut.
- On average, 16% of bought games are refunded on Steam. (Yaengard was more, ~17.2%)

These are all true, even though 16% (7000 games) of games were free, and 58% (~23K games) cost $4.99 or less. An additional 22% (9K games) sold for between $5 and $10.
In large, this is due to game development being accessible, and many gamers dreaming of adding their creation to Steam. But for those of us not just dreaming, but trying to build games for a living, it becomes a sobering truth.

More and more games are being released as gaming grows, kids grow up dreaming of making games, and it is easier now than ever. Additionally, both tools and distribution is much more accessible than it once were (including the arrival of coding LLMs).

**Pricing Mistakes**
- As a business guideline, higher price is nearly always better on Steam. However, your game must match the tier of its pricing.
- Only 1.5% of theses games costs $40 or more.
- Less than 0.2% of these games have AAA pricing (>$60)
- ~95% costs less than $20.

For each steam review (positive or negative), about 50-60 copies are sold (Funnily enough, my indie game sold EXACTLY 50 copies per review in its first year). You need about 500 reviews for a game release to sustain a tiny indie development team. Double it if you have a publisher, which generally takes a 50/50 revenue split these days for indie game companies. 

## Consider your business options. Don't go in blind.
Most indie games will fail. That is a truth, and it is okey. We all build games because we love games. Solo developer, pair, or a team; the data is fairly clear. For many, that is alright. They want to create a game, and in most cases 5-20 people try your game. Steam gives you the platform to do that for only $100 and a few hours of work to get going.

But did you know that if you release your game on consoles, the median result is a 1:1 sales ratio between PC and consoles (very region and game dependent)? In many cases it is much higher, with console sales dominating for example europe. Yet, 95% of games are single-platform games. To build a indie game development studio, you need to re-adjust your thinking. It can't be all passion project. You have to learn how the game is played, and then decide what % should be business and what % should be passion.

## Facts to consider

Making some basic assumptions of income and development time (~12-16 months), here are some facts to consider:
- For a 1-2 people game studio, you need to reach ~40 000 wishlist and hit ~200 reviews. 
- For a 4-5 people game studio, you need ~90 000 wishlists, and hit ~500+ reviews.

Scout around for games in these ranges, and find out what your benchmark must be!

- If you release with a publisher, these numbers requirements will double (40 000 / 200 -> 80 000 wishlists / 400 reviews)
- If you release on major console platforms (Xbox, Playstation, Switch), these required numbers are cut in half (canceling out the publisher)
- Releasing on mobile can be a gamechanger.
- Localizing your game and pricing can nearly double your sales and playerbase, once again cutting the benchmarks in half.
- If you cut your development time in half (by reducing the scope), your required sales is also reduced by the same amount.

## What you can do as an indie dev
If you want to have a chance to build a future in the gaming industry as a independent game developer, you need your eyes open. As I am once again considering building a game, I will document my journey and thoughts to share with others. My white whale in game development has always been the game that does fine in sales, but ALWAYS puts the players first. I believe it can be done.

I come from business, product, and have a lot of experience from the "evil" side of game development. But it isn't really evil. It is just business. That's alright. Knowing the business and industry can let passion project bloom into something that changes the industry we love. I wish more indie game developers could learn just enough of the business side that they thrive, and build the next generation of fantastic blows-AAA-out-of-the-FUCKING-water indie games.
