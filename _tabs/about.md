I am Will Wadbrant, indie game developer and cross-platform gaming product manager.
This is my personal site where I write about projects I work on, product management, the gaming industry, AI, and leadership.

Professionally I do many things, but my heart is in the gaming industry.
Endless curiosity, love to enable others, & doing what matters.
