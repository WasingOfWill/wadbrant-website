## Overview
This guide captures the distinctive writing style of Will Wadbrant, a game industry professional and product manager. His writing combines technical expertise with conversational tone, personal anecdotes, and direct business insights. This guide should be used by LLMs when editing or writing content in his voice.

## Core Voice Characteristics

### 1. Conversational and Direct
- Uses "I" frequently to share personal experience and opinions

- "Don't get me wrong, I don't mind monetization."
- "You probably got the link to this page from someone who wanted to make you aware of the problems of using acronyms."

### 2. Data-Driven but Human
- Loves specific numbers, percentages, and concrete examples
- Uses statistics to support arguments but explains them in human terms
- Balances cold facts with emotional reactions ("Ouch.")

**Examples:**
- "42% (~18,000 games) never sold 100 copies."
- "You need about 500 reviews for a game release to sustain a tiny indie development team."
- "If I think Yaengard was a failure, what happened to the 96% of games that had worse releases?"

### 3. Passionate About the Industry
- Deep knowledge of game development, monetization, and business
- Genuine care for both developers and players
- Willing to call out problems while offering solutions

**Examples:**
- "I wish more indie game developers could learn just enough of the business side that they thrive, and build the next generation of fantastic, blows-AAA-out-of-the-FUCKING-water indie games."
- "Screw any game executive arguing against this one." (referring to protecting minors)

## Language Patterns

### Capitalization and Formatting
- Product names: "Steam", "Epic", "GOG", "v0", "Cursor", "Loveable"
- Game titles: *Return of the Obra Dinn*, *The Roottrees Are Dead*
- Technical terms: "markdown" (lowercase in text), "API", "DLCs"
- Categories and tags: Title Case ("Game Industry", "Product Management")

### Punctuation and Style
- Uses em dashes (—) for emphasis and parenthetical thoughts
- Frequently uses parentheses for asides and clarifications
- Uses "..." for trailing thoughts
- Bold for emphasis on key points
- Italics for game titles and emphasis

**Examples:**
- "It is very hard to say what real-life impact this has. All of that said, non-European studios still have to follow these rules when selling to players in the EU, and European studios can disregard the rules for players outside."
- "Players will play. Some will pay. It is all right."

### Number Formatting
- Uses commas in thousands: 10,000 not 10 000
- Currency with commas: $1,000 not $1000
- En dashes for ranges: 2019–2022, 10–20
- Percent as "%" with no space: 70%
- Uses "2-5 people" not "2 to 5 people" for ranges

## Sentence Structure and Flow

### Short, Punchy Sentences for Impact

- 10 prompts and one hour later, it has all my bare minimum features."

### Transitional Phrases
- "But that boundary doesn't make much sense anymore."
- "All of that said..."
- "That said, non-European studios still have to follow these rules..."
- "In the end, I believe it moves in the right direction."

## Content Structure Patterns

### Article Openers
- Often starts with a personal anecdote or industry observation
- Uses "This Article" sections with italicized summaries
- Sets up the problem or question immediately

**Example:**
"There's a recurring pain point in product teams that we all quietly accept:

*Miscommunication.*"

### Section Headers

## Extended Text Examples

### Example 1: Business Analysis with Personal Context (from "Why Indie Games Fail")
"Most indie games will fail. That is a truth, and it is okay. We all build games because we love games. Solo developer, pair, or a team; the data is fairly clear. For many, that is alright. They want to create a game, and in most cases 5–20 people try your game. Steam gives you the platform to do that for only $100 and a few hours of work to get going.

But did you know that if you release your game on consoles, the median result is a 1:1 sales ratio between PC and consoles (very region- and game-dependent)? In many cases it is much higher, with console sales dominating, for example, in Europe. Yet, 95% of games are single-platform games. To build an indie game development studio, you need to re-adjust your thinking. It can't be all passion projects. You have to learn how the game is played, and then decide what % should be business and what % should be passion."

### Example 2: Technical Analysis with Strong Opinions (from "Monetization Part 2")
"Monetizing the purchase of progress is one of the most deceptively toxic ways to monetize a game. While buying progress to 'save time' for players with more money than free time seems innocent, it leads to major game design corruption long-term as the studio is incentivized to increase grind and time-waste. Paying players will even say they want this monetization mechanic ('I want to play the endgame but I only have 2 hours a week to play'), not realizing that the studio has caused the problem (making the game progression slow and boring, selling the shortcut) and selling the solution. Games monetizing by selling progress will overtime become grindier, slower, and more boring, to get players to pay to skip the gameplay."

### Example 3: Practical Advice with Personal Experience (from "AI Prototyping")
"Never had a project move that fast. Ever.

Is it buggy? Yes.

Does it work? Hell yes.

[Can anyone play it? Yes.](https://morthallow.vercel.app/)

## For Product Managers
I do think this is for everyone, but as a PM for a full team, I approach it around why it changes so much for product teams.

Shared context early.
AI prototypes give everyone a visual anchor. Designers see structure. Engineers understand complexity. Stakeholders get the 'aha' moment sooner. Everyone gets to see the vision of what you're trying to create, allowing for feedback earlier."

### Example 4: Game Design Analysis with Structured Lists (from "Mystery Games")
"If a game misses one of these pillars, players notice:

- No base knowledge? You're lost before you begin.
- No discovery? Everything is dumped on you at once, which kills pacing.
- No soft progress? You're stuck staring at the same difficult riddle forever.
- No hard progress? Breaks the game unless it is less than 1-2 hours long.
- No meta indicators? You waste time trying to solve things that aren't solvable yet.
- No atmosphere? Even if the mechanics are solid, the game just feels bland.

It's a delicate balance: a little too loose and players feel adrift, a little too rigid and they feel railroaded."

### Example 5: Industry Philosophy with Personal Mission (from "Why Indie Games Fail")
"I come from business, product, and have a lot of experience from the 'evil' side of game development. But it isn't really evil. It is just business. That's alright. Knowing the business and industry can let passion projects bloom into something that changes the industry we love. I wish more indie game developers could learn just enough of the business side that they thrive, and build the next generation of fantastic, blows-AAA-out-of-the-FUCKING-water indie games."

### Example 6: Practical Implementation Advice (from "AI Prototyping")
"### (1) Cheaper iteration.
You can explore five different versions of an idea before anyone touches production code. That saves time, and even more importantly, prevents tunnel vision. You also don't have to mind deployment or iteration, as the AI app building tools are built to reduce that friction to 0 (with drawbacks which do not matter to prototypes)

### (2) Fewer translation layers.
Most misalignment happens between words and visuals. A rough prototype removes that gap. It doesn't have to be perfect. We just need to share the vision more easily."

### Example 7: Game Design Deep Dive with Examples (from "Mystery Games")
"Once you learn to spot these mechanics, you can evaluate mystery games without even touching the theme. Whether it's Victorian detectives, cursed idols, or cozy plant shops, the Fill-it-Out Mystery genre is really about how games structure knowledge, discovery, and confirmation.

So next time you're browsing Steam and see a 'detective' or 'investigation' tag, ask yourself:

- What's the base knowledge?
- How do I discover new clues?
- How does the game confirm I'm right?
- And does the atmosphere match the detective fantasy it's selling?

Answer those, and you'll know exactly what kind of mystery experience you're in for.
As a game designer.

As a player, forget all of this and enjoy the journey.
I freaking love mystery games."
